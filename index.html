            <h2>To boost the novel idea of starting up on Orphanage, here are the 8 basic technicalities.</h2><br><br>
<p>Place: First thing is to have a piece of property registered in the Orphanages name, if it’s not budgeted the alternative is to lease the property for the long term say 15- 20 years. Re model the place to suit the children’s need with Safe play area, dining room, prayer room and Library. Set up all the facilities before Orphan children are welcomed.</p> <br>
<p>Legality: All Orphanages in India should be registered under the ‘’ Care and protection of children act under Juvenile Justice. Get in contact with District social welfare officer for more details on the process. Also get familiar with “Law of child adoption, Guardian and custody”,” Basic education act” etc. It is better to consult a lawyer to be sure that every legal attribute is taken care, just to avoid future consequences with laws.</p><br>
<p>Pan No. and Bank Ac: Register the orphanage for PAN number under Tax Free Status. Also open a bank account to have the track of donations and Expenses.</p><br>
<p>80 G Certificate: Consult a chartered accountant and get the 80G certificate, so that donor can avail the benefit of Tax exemption.
Register under FCRA: If you wish to get the foreign contribution to develop your orphanage, creating an FCRA account under – Foreigners contribution regulation act is a must; it is done through Ministry of Home affairs.</p><br>
<p>Fund rising: Lot of fund will be required to run an orphanage, the need of fund increases more with the growth of orphanage. Self-funding will not be sufficient for long run, hence there is an option for bank loans. Be ready with the detailed project report with all minute details as bank demands it for processing the loan. Another considerable idea is, over a period of time establish associated income generating business to self-sustain the orphanage.</p><br>
<p>Network – Have a good relationship with political house, police department, journalist, human right activist and other social organizations who will help in getting the funds as well as bringing the orphans.</p><br>
<p>Coworkers – Recruit few service oriented employees based on your budget. It is quite difficult to get efficient, trust worthy people who can work for cheap, but it is not impossible. Minimum 2-part time, one cook and one housekeeping staff along with care taker working 24 hours around the clock is must to start. Later, based on need, an accountant, consultant Lawyer, accountant can be hired.</p><br>
<blockquote>Even after fulfilling all the required technical aspect to start an Orphanage, one has to face lot of hindrance in managing day to day activities. However, over a period of time lot of things will be learnt, tasks become familiar, children get settled and it becomes easy to concentrate on improving the orphanage.

It is advisable to visit few established orphanages to understand its working model, read related books to acquire more knowledge and information. Start up with 2- 3 kids initially and understand the intricacies involved, later orphanage can be gradually expanded.</blockquote>

<h4> How to register an orphanage in India?</h4><br>

<p>Legality: All Orphanages in India should be registered under the ‘’ Care and protection of children act under Juvenile Justice. Get in contact with District social welfare officer for more details on the process. Also get familiar with “Law of child adoption, Guardian and custody”,” Basic education act” etc.</p><br><br>

<h4>Why are orphanages and group homes declining?</h4> <br>

<p>The report further stated that the revenue for the Orphanages and Group Homes industry has been adjusted from an increase to a decline of 12.2 percent in 2020 due to declining federal funding and donations. Since many operators are nonprofit, orphanages and group homes rely on federal funding and private donations.</p>
